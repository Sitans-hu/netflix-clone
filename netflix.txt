I meticulously crafted the front-end interface of the Netflix clone using HTML and CSS to ensure a sleek, intuitive, and responsive user experience. The layout mirrors the real Netflix design with a clean navigation bar, grid-based content display, and dynamic elements such as hover effects and carousels for showcasing movies and series. Media queries were employed to ensure full responsiveness across different devices, maintaining a visually appealing and functional design from desktop to mobile. The design focuses on user accessibility, ease of navigation, and visual aesthetics that mimic the Netflix platform.
